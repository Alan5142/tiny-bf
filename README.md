# What is this?
This is a tiny brainfuck interpreter, not tiny in the sense of lines of code but in the sense of the executable.

THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO THINGS.

This interpreter aims for a small binary size. It does not handle errors, memory overflows and bla bla bla.

## How to compile?

**For x86**
```bash
./build.sh
```

**For x86_64**
```bash
./build-x86_64.sh
```

## Binary size

| x86       | x86_64    |
|-----------|-----------|
| 388 bytes | 528 bytes |
